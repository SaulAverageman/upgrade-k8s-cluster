k8s versioning
   [MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
eg: 1     . 3     . 12

Ma2jor version rarely will be changed.

Minor verisons come out every 4 months and are supported for a year
Patches come out every month.

So AKS and Kubernetes support the current minor version and previous 2 verisons.
(1.5-current, 1.4-supported, 1.3-supported) 

Also only 2 stable patches are supported for every supported version.
(1.5-current/supported, 1.5.a-supported, 1.5.b-supported)

If the current version is supported by AKS, only the upgradation to the next higher minor version is supported.
(1.3-current&supported, upgrade to 1.4.a or 1.4.b)

If the current version is not supported by AKS, upgradation to any supported version is allowed.
(1.2-current & not-supported, upgrade to - 1.3, 1.4, 1.5)

Node pools and control plane can have different versions. 
Node pool(kubelet) can be 2 supported verisons behind the control plane.
(control plane-1.5, node pool-1.3/1.4)
node pool version <= master plane version
